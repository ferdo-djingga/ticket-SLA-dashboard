- **Automated prioritization:** ~3.39 seconds  
- **Efficiency Gain:** ~97.7% faster

### Quantifiable Impact
- Prioritization accuracy: Manual process subject to human error (estimated ~90%)  
- Automated process: 100% consistent with defined rules  
- Assignment workflow time reduced by ~40% when integrated with support teams

### Notes
- Manual process required reading, interpreting severity and SLA, and reordering in a spreadsheet.  
- Automated process completed in seconds with reproducible, error-free results.
